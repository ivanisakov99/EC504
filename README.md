# EC504_Advanced_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures
## <ins>Course Content</ins>
Data structures are widely employed to store data in an efficient manner, and can improve computational efficiency by orders of magnitude. We will begin 
the course with a quick review of: 

1. C++ syntax and language features 
2. Analysis techniques for algorithms and data structures
3. Simple data structures. 

We will then proceed to examine more complicated data structure containers, including balanced search trees and priority queues, with applications to databases 
and query processing. Thereafter we will examine graph-based structures, including traversals, spanning trees, shortest paths, and flows, within the context of
networks. We will conclude with a choice of advanced topics, such as NP completeness, approximation algorithms, game solvers, etc, together with applications.
Throughout the course we will focus on rigorous analysis and realistic applications.
