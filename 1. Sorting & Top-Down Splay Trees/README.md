### <ins>Problem 1: Different Sorting Algorithms</ins>
In this exercise, you are to implement four sorting algorithms to sort arrays of integers and compare them on two sorting inputs. The sorting algorithms
to be implemented are:

• Insertion Sort

• Merge Sort

• Merge Sort Blend, where, when in the recursion you find you have 32 or less items to sort, you do insertion sort and don’t recur further.

• A simple version of Timsort, to be described below.

All of the sorting routines are to be implemented in the header file *sorting.h*. The main file can be used for debugging, but should not be changed.

The codes will sort two lists of integers. The first list is randomly generated in the main program. The second list is read from file. You cannot change
the original *sortScaling.cpp* file, but you can write your own main program for debugging with smaller list lengths if you wish. Once you have completed this,
you can make the executable using *make all*. You can then run *./sort >> sort.out*.

Now, here is a brief description of simpleTimsort:

    Set minrunsize to 32. Initialise runstack as array, with runstack[0] = 0, and num_in_stack = 0;
    input array a[], with n elements
    for i in 0 to n-1,
      find a run of nondecreasing entries in i.
      If run length is less than minrunsize, insert element of a[i] into the run and continue;
      If run length is greater than or equal to minrunsize, increment num_in_stack, store the index of the run
      (i.e. the current value of i) into runstack[num_in_stack].
    if i gets to n-1, increment num_in_stack and set runstack[num_in_stack] to n.
    
    Now, collapse the stack of runs as follows: While num_in_stack > 1, do
    Merge the last two runs (starting at runstack[num_in_stack-2] and runstack[num_in_stack - 1]);
    decrement num_in_stack by 1 and set runstack[num_in_stack] = n;
    
This last step is inefficient, and does not merge in the same clever way Timsort does, maintaining an invariant. This will be easier to implement, and even
with the inefficiencies, will show how Timsort works when the data is nearly sorted.

**Extra credit**: Implement a better simpleTimsort by managing the stack dynamically as follows: Whenever you insert a run into the stack, if its length
is greater than or equal to the run below in the stack, merge it right away. Continue this merging recursively into the stack before starting the next run.

Hence, if we have a stack with runs of length 128, 64, 32 and you insert a run of length 32 on top, you first merge it with the top of 32, yielding a
size 64 run. Then, you merge that with the 64, yielding a 128 run, which you merge with the 128 run, leaving a single run of length 256 in the stack.
This algorithm will be faster than both versions of mergesort on random data.

### <ins>Problem 2: Top-Down Splay Trees</ins>
The purpose of this exercise is to learn to implement top-down splay trees. Top-down splay trees are the preferred way to implement splay trees, 
for many reasons. First, we don’t need to point to parent nodes, so the nodes are smaller. Second, by going top-down, double rotations are treated
as single rotations, and many operations are easily implemented.

For instance, consider the Insert operation. Instead of inserting the key into the splay tree and splaying up, you simply splay the key into the tree, 
and the node that becomes the new root is the node which would be the parent of where the key was to be inserted. It is then easy to insert the new node 
at the root, and make the root one of its children.

Similarly, for Delete, one splays the key top down, and if the key is in the tree, it is the new root of the tree, so we can delete it, and be left 
with a right subtree and a left subtree. To find the largest value in the left subtree, we splay the deleted key into that left subtree, and the new root 
will be the largest value! This makes it trivial to connect the right subtree to the new root of the left subtree and finish delete.

The Search operation becomes a one-line operation: splay the key to be searched and it is at the root of the returned tree.

In this problem, we provide you with a main function topdownsplay.cpp, which contains a Class called SplayTree that implements a top-down splay tree, but
is missing three key member functions:

    Tree_node* Splay(int key, Tree_node* root) 
    Tree_node* Right_Rotate(Tree_node* k2)
    Tree_node* Left_Rotate(Tree_node* k2)

SplayTree takes in a key value, and a pointer to the root of the splay tree as input, and performs a top-down splay operation on this key value, 
returning the new root of the resulting splay tree. The other two functions take in the root of a tree, and do a single rotation to the right or left, 
returning the new root.

A brief pseudocode for this function is:

    function Splay(int key, Tree_node* root)
        if root is null, return null;
        Create a Tree_node Tree to grow the right, left subtrees as we go down.
        Initialise right and left children of Tree as null
        Initialise the pointers Rpoint, Lpoint as to where to insert left and right subtrees
        Do until break:
            if key < root key,
                if root has no left_child, break out of Do;
                if (key <  left_child’s key)
                    rotate root to the right, using Right_Rotate.
                    if the new root has no left child, break out of Do;
                Split current root and all of its right descendants into right subtree by:
                    Make Rpoint’s left child point to root
                    Define new Rpoint equal to root
                    Define new root to be root’s left child
                    Make Rpoint’s left child null
            else if (key > root->key)
                if root has no right child, break out of do.
                if (key > right_child’s key)
                    rotate root to the left, using Left_Rotate
                    if the new root has no right child, break out of Do
                Split current root and all its left descendants to left subtree by:
                    Make Lpoint’s right child point to root
                    Define new Lpoint to point to root
                    Define new root to be root’s right child
                    Make Lpoint’s right child to be null
            else break out of Do: the root has the key you are looking for.
        Assemble the final splay tree by merging center, left and right, by:
            Make Lpoint’s right child point to root’s left child
            Make Rpoint’s left child point to root’s right child
            Make root’s left child point to Tree’s right child
            Make root’s right child point to Tree’s left child
        return root
